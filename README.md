Moomoo and its relationship with A.I
Moomoo: Origins, Inspiration, and Funding
Founding and History:
Moomoo, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based fintech company Futu Holdings, doesn't explicitly state its incorporation date on its "About" webpage. However, Investopedia mentions Moomoo's founding year as 2018, with its headquarters established in Silicon Valley, California [1, 2]. 
Moomoo's website sheds light on the inspiration behind the platform:
"Moomoo was created because we realized that the investment platforms available were either too complicated with high fees or too simplistic without the necessary tools." [1]
This statement suggests Moomoo aimed to bridge the gap between complex, high-fee platforms and overly simplified ones, offering a user-friendly interface with advanced tools at an accessible cost.  
While details about Moomoo's specific funding rounds aren't readily available on their website, Investopedia provides some insights:
"Futu Holdings, Moomoo's parent company, has received significant funding rounds, including a $1.2 billion Series G funding in 2021." [2]
This indicates that Moomoo benefits from the financial backing of its parent company, which has attracted substantial venture capital investments.
An issue that Moomoo is trying to solve, plain and simply is how to get more consumers to invest with their platform. This issue is always going to be present in the investing field in regards to different trading scenarios. When it comes to the A.I field though, a big problem is going to be “Lack of Transparency: AI and ML algorithms can be complex and difficult to understand, which can make it challenging for traders to fully understand how investment recommendations are being generated. Lack of transparency can make it difficult for traders to trust the recommendations being provided.”[3] Consumers are always going to pay close attention to their money and do not like unsure feelings about what will happen to their money, especially with investing. AI and ML offer valuable insights, but traders should use their judgment and expertise for investment decisions, not solely relying on technology. Other issues that will arise will be Data Quality, Unforeseen events and potential for manipulation. “As with any technology, there is always the potential for AI and ML algorithms to be manipulated or exploited for nefarious purposes. Traders should be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate measures to help protect their investments and personal information.” [3] To be frank, when dealing with anything that has to do with A.I, you just have to understand the risks because artificial intelligence is here to stay! Once you understand this, you are ready to be a valued customer. 
In order to be a Moomoo customer, you have to have an account with Moomoo. Since Moomoo offers financial services, you have to open a funding account with their database. With this being said, Moomoo has an intended customer that wants to invest and trade, via their financial account, with the platform. Moomoo makes their revenue from customers “through the difference in its funding rate and the margin rates customers pay, as well as through the different between what Moomoo pays customers in interest and the rate at which it can invest its customers’ spare cash.” [2]. Based on this business model, Moomoo is able to service its over “23 million global users”.[1}
Staying on the topic of artificial intelligence, Moomoo may offer similar advantages and disadvantages as many of its competitors due to the time table of platforms incorporating A.I. The A.I that Moomoo uses does give personalized recommendations that monitor trading history, trends and preferences which are extremely easy to access. The ease of use and balanced recommendations give a severe advantage over competitors. Due to this likability it’s obvious how they have been able to grow from “17 million” users In 2024 to over 23 million users, and growing, currently. [4}
Moomoo, a financial technology company, heavily relies on cloud computing services like AWS and Google Cloud Platform for scalability and global presence. They use robust database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB for data management. Their development teams use Python and JavaScript for platform construction and maintenance, and use React or Vue.js for frontend interfaces. They also use React Native or Flutter for mobile app development for iOS and Android platforms. These are all speculatory since Moomoo does not publicly share its technologies. These are likely true due to Moomoos size and what program options would match the scalability and output that Moomoo displays. 
“Moomoo is a financial information and trading app offered by Moomoo Technologies Inc. In the U.S., investment products and services on Moomoo are offered by Moomoo Financial Inc., Member FINRA/SIPC.” [5] Over the last 5 to 10 years, The financial landscape is changing due to fintech advances, which promote inclusivity, efficiency, and security. These developments are establishing new benchmarks for the industry, from real-time payments and mobile-only banking to embedded finance and blockchain. The future holds even more possibility for transformation as these technologies continue to advance. In order to remain competitive and fulfill the changing demands of their clientele, financial institutions need to adopt these technologies. 
Some examples of these innovations include Mobile only banking, Real time payments, A.I & Machine Learning and Peer-to-peer Lending. With P2P Lending “Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as a significant innovation in the fintech landscape, enabling individuals and businesses to borrow money directly from other individuals without traditional financial intermediaries. This model democratises access to credit, often providing better interest rates for both borrowers and lenders.”[6] With mobile only banking, “also known as neobanks, has emerged as a transformative force in the financial sector. On average, 60% of all large bank customers are mobile-first, making it the default mode for consumer finance. Neobanks like Chime, Monzo, and Nubank have set new industry standards by offering checking account-like services exclusively through mobile platforms.”[6]
With real time payments, “they enable zero-cost, instant domestic transactions, significantly impacting both developed and emerging markets. In countries like the UK, Australia, and Singapore, real-time payments via banking apps or wallets have largely replaced traditional methods like checks and cash.”
With AI and machine learning, AI and machine learning have the potential to revolutionise financial services by improving decision-making, enhancing customer experiences, and increasing operational efficiency.” With these innovations, it leads to a very competitive field and some key players aside from Moomoo are: E- Trade, Fidelity, TradeStation, Robinhood, Webull, Charles Schwab and eToro. [7] 
With the high competition, Moomoo is the very best due to the simple fact that it has the lowest fees out of all the platforms. It has a simple, easy to navigate interface that only keeps advancing. Using Webull as an example you can clearly see that Moomoo has more users, Over 3 million to be exact. This example was used due to the fact that both came into the game in 2018 so this is a key performance indicator to test which is more preferred. Going further platforms like Robinhood have fluctuated due to bad business practices and problems with cashing out, etc. This has not been the case with Moomoo. Its clear which company implements the best R&D method to ensure the success of the platform. 
If I were to advise Moomoo I would encourage them to try their best to implement an immediate cash out button. People now days want their money when they want it and the deposit and withdraw interface within Moomoo takes a bit. Its understood though that its difficult to implement something of the sort due to the fact that checks and balances have to take place before money is allowed to be deposited or withdrawn. Over time, if this problem can be resolved this would lead to the best user experience possible. If I were simply throwing another suggestion out there using my imagination, I’d simply incorporate a sort of deposit ‘no sweat’ style feature like fan duel has. Buying stocks is a gamble in itself and this feature in fan duel ensures that if money is lost you’d get a portion of your money back. On the backend, Moomoo makes money as you make it. Fanduel gives you all your money back on a no sweat, but even doing something like half would yield nice profits. Its just a suggestion. The technologies needed would be similar to draft kings or fanduel. If the name of the game is money and investing, this would be a nice curve ball to throw in.
